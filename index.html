<div class="black-text-color"><b>HTML</b>-<em>Hyper Text Markup Language
</em><br> HTML is the Basis for each Web Page. 
<br>
<Br>
<b>HTML is made up of:</b><br>
-Text Content<br>
-Markup<br>
-Images and Video<br>
-Links to other pages<br>

    <p>
  <b>HTML</b> shows the structure of the web page, and can be thought of as a Tree Like Structure which is also called the <b>"DOM"</b>-Document Object Module. <br>
<em>Text Content</em> still shows up as text within HTML, but how you format it will change the context to be important to the reader. <br>
<EM>Markup</EM> changes the look of plain text to <b>Bold</b>, <em> Italics</em>, etc. You can also include Links.</p>

    <h2 class="subheader">CSS</h2>
    <p>
  <b>CSS</b> is also a language and controls the style of a page and how it looks. Within each Web Page, the HTML Structure and CSS Style code can be viewed in the <em>Developer Tools</em> view. CSS allows you to use <b>Selectors</b> to avoid repetition in code, and to create rules for formatting. By changing one item in CSS, it will change your layout desired, and avoid the need for HTML recoding-<em>AWESOME!!!</em>
There are several Text Editors available to assist the program writer-CodePen, ScratchPad, and Sublime Text to assist with <b>HTML,</b> and <b>CSS</b> code.</p>

      <h2 class="subheader">Code Structure</h2>
    <p>Before Web Designer begins to think of the Web Page code, layout is the first plan of action! How should the Website look? Since a page is essentially boxes, what content would naturally look best in each box? This is called <b>Box Positioning and includes Margins, Borders, Padding, and Content</b>. Repeated styles and semantic elements should then be considered. <em>Then</em> write the HTML. Apply the styles from <B>BIGGEST</b> to smallest. Then take a good look at your web page and tweak what you don't care for.</P>
